**data_herbivory_o.xlsx**: All the original data collected in this paper.

**data_herbivory_final.xlsx**: Part of the original data. Due to database resolution limitations, samples from certain locations got meaningless climate or soil values, such as samples near water bodies. So this Excel is the dataset that supports all of our research. Additionally, we have included all the environmental data (climate and soil) in this Excel file, allowing you to access a ready-to-use dataset for analysis without the need to run our code. You can see the description of all variables in Supplementary Table S1 of this paper.

**herbivory_global_mapping.ipynb**All codes used in this study. You can try running it using Python + jupyter notebook.
